        <p>Hello, my name is Jecks Randall D. Andrada and I am from Philippines. Iâ€™m naturally a bit of a shy guy, but once you get to know me, Iâ€™m a lot of fun to be around! I love comediesâ€”laughter is my kind of therapyâ€”and Iâ€™m always excited to discover new things, whether itâ€™s a fresh hobby, an interesting idea, or a hidden gem in tech. Right now, Iâ€™m diving into the world of web design and development as a student at BYU Pathway, and Iâ€™m absolutely thrilled to expand my skills in software development. I canâ€™t wait to see my own website designs come to life and eventually build programs that generate income. The future? Itâ€™s bright, and Iâ€™m ready for it. Join me, and letâ€™s uncover the endless possibilities aheadâ€”together!</p>
